This is server side (Backend) portion of my full stack MERN app with CRUD operations. For my client side (Frontend) I used React and I deployed it on Github pages. For my server side (Backend) I used Node JS, Mongo DB, Mongoose and Express and I depoyed my server on Render (https://render.com/). Since I am using the free version of RENDER, here is a chance of slow requests due to inactivity (50 seconds or more, so please wait for your first request).
